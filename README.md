## Project Description

This project is an interactive command line Hangman game implemented in Python. It selects a random word from a list, and the player attempts to guess it letter by letter. The aim is to demonstrate fundamental Python programming skills such as control structures, data structures, and user input handling, along with object-oriented programming.

Key learnings include string manipulation, conditional statements, Python's random library, and basics of object-oriented programming.

## Installation
