## Project Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The aim of this project is to demonstrate basic Python programming skills, including control structures, data structures (lists), and user input handling. Through this project, I learned about string manipulation, conditional statements, and the random library in Python.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Python can be downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once Python is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmsm1g19/hangman.git
cd hangman-game
```

## Usage

To play the game, run the Python script from the command line:

```bash
python hangman.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters in an attempt to figure out the hidden word. The game continues until you guess the word or run out of attempts.

## File Structure

- `hangman.py`: The main Python script that runs the hangman game.
- `README.md`: This file, containing documentation and instructions.
